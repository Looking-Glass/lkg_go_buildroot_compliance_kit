## 🛠 Reconstruction Instructions

To reproduce the binaries from this package, you will need a Linux host system (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).

### 1. Run the Automator Script
The included `reconstruct.sh` script automates the environment setup. It performs the following actions:
1.  **Dependency Check**: Verifies required host tools (gcc, make, rsync, git, etc.).
2.  **Environment Setup**: Clones the exact version of **Buildroot** used for this release via a specific Git Hash.
3.  **Offline Lockdown**: Configures Buildroot for **Strict Offline Mode**.
4.  **Path Linking**: Automatically maps `BR2_EXTERNAL`, ` and `BR2_DL_DIR` to the local bundled directories.

```bash
chmod +x reconstruct.sh
./reconstruct.sh
```

### 2. Start the Build
Once the script completes, navigate to the generated build directory and execute `make`:

```bash
cd output
make
```

## ⚖️ Buildroot Compliance & Legal Info

This package was generated using the Buildroot `make legal-info` infrastructure, enhanced with custom auditing scripts to ensure 100% compliance while protecting proprietary assets.

### How this meets compliance:
* **Source Redistribution**: Buildroot extracts the exact source archives for every package used in the build into the `sources/` directory.
* **Scripts for Compilation**: The inclusion of the `.config`, the `BR2_EXTERNAL` tree, and the `buildroot_patches` folder fulfills the requirement to provide the "scripts used to control compilation."
* **Offline Reproducibility**: By pinning the Buildroot version to a specific **Git Hash** and enforcing `BR2_PRIMARY_SITE_ONLY=y`, we ensure the build is not dependent on external servers that may change or disappear.
* **License Manifest**: Buildroot generates the raw data, which we provide in both CSV and formatted HTML for auditing.

### 🛡 Proprietary Software Note
Internal proprietary components are identified in the `license_report.html` as **Proprietary**. In accordance with their respective licenses, the source code for these specific components is **not** included in the `sources/` directory.
